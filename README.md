# PIMPC-GNN
This project implements graph neural networks that integrate principles from physics, including thermodynamics via heat diffusion for feature propagation, oscillator dynamics using Kuramoto models for synchronisation analysis, and spectral analysis through eigenvalue decomposition to understand graph structure.
